# RSA Algorithm
 
The RSAtool is a python script I have written in order to practically demonstrate the weakness of bad RSA principles.

In the case here, p and q are prime numbers that do not have a big difference between them.

By providing a public key (modulus and the exponent), the script will allow you to decipher a ciphertext associated with the key.
